# Get-5Hash
-------------------------------------
A quick script will prompt the user to input the remote computer name and the file path. This will allow you to get a file hash from a machine remotely and 
provide five algorithms for that same file to build better IOCs' or for Threat Hunting (MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512). The output file will be on your 
Desktop. Open the output .csv file in Excel for a better view.
